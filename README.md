# ProjectPSX

**ProjectPSX is a C# coded emulator of the original Sony Playstation (PSX)**

*This is a personal project with the scope to learn about hardware and the development of emulators.*

ProjectPSX dosn't use any external dependency and uses rather simplistyc C# code.

At the moment the following is implemented:
- CPU and GTE Coprocessor
- Partial CDROM
- Partial GPU
...

> **Note:**  A valid SCPH1001.BIN PlayStation Bios is needed to run the emulator. 

## Compability

The emulator is in very early development and there are constant rewrites. Somehow and although with some limitations there are some games that already work like:
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer Revolution, Ace Combat, Final Fantasy 7, Time Crisis, Crash Bandicoot 1 2 and 3, Spyro the dragon...

> **Note:**  Memory Card files are unsupported so any progress will be lost upon exit.


## Using the emulator

The emulator should work dragging a BIN iso or a PSX EXE to the GUI.
Yet this is still unimplented and the CD names are hardcoded as strings on the CD Class and the Bios on the Bus Class.
 
Once power on, Input is mapped as:

* D-Pad UP: **Up**
* D-Pad Left: **Left**
* D-Pad Down: **Down**
* D-Pad Right: **Right**
* Triangle: **W**
* Square: **A**
* X: **S**
* Circle: **D**
* Start: **Enter**
* Select: **Space**
* L1: **Q**
* R1: **E**
* L2: **1**
* R2: **2**

## Quick Faq

- What's up with that window with all the weird colors and the double game screen?

As the emulator is early on development theres no real tv output "screen". What you see is the Playstation whole VRAM. It includes all the textures and color lockup tables used by the games. Also almost all games on the PSX used double buffering, that's why there's 2 game screens on the VRAM as the hardware draws on one and outputs the other.

- Why "insert game here" doesn't work?

Probably due to not implemented hardware. Per example Parasite Eve loads but main screen looks awful as 24bpp is not supported yet. Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Gran Turismo crash after some loading or main screen because CDROM timmings needs to be reworked.

- How can i get console TTY or BIOS output?

Uncomment the bios.verbose() or TTY() functions on the CPU main loop. You can also dissasemble() the MIPS CPU instructions and printRegs() on the current opcode.

- Why there's green squares as textures on Ridge Racer or magic looks solid in Final Fantasy 7?

At the moment there's no texture blending or transparency support implemented.

- Why both RTPS and RTPT Geometry Transformation Engine Coprocessor commands give wrong values on tests?

At the moment i just use common division where the original PSX uses a fastest, but less accurate division mechanism (based on Unsigned Newton-Raphson (UNR) algorithm.

- Why you did this?

I have been interested in emulating hardware for some time. I started doing a Java [Chip8](https://github.com/BluestormDNA/Chip8) and a C# [Intel 8080 CPU](https://github.com/BluestormDNA/i8080-Space-Invaders) (used on the classic arcade Space Invaders). Later i did [Nintendo Gameboy](https://github.com/BluestormDNA/ProjectDMG) and i wanted to keep forward to do some 3D so i ended with the PSX...


- How you did this?

I  mainly used Martin Korth PSX-SPX documentation about the Playstation hardware at https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm
Also the people at the #playstation channel on the emudev discord at https://discord.gg/dkmJAes was very helpfull.
